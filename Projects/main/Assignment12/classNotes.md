strong advice, if you go online, if you like the code online, don't copy it... study the code and understand it so you see their algorithms and how they do it
notice there are small things done in the code that are the programmers signatures. ( like how i use //end at the end of every closing tag )
Sometimes programmers have a tendency to post up some more signatured code to avoid people from copying the code etc...
